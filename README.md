## Usage:

- Put the .jar in your mods folder by pressing `Windows + R` and typing in `%appdata%` open the `.minecraft/mods` folder.
- Press `RSHIFT` to open the ClickGUI
- The prefix is `*`

## Setting up:
- Run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` in terminal.
- Refresh Gradle.

## Debugging:
- Run `gradlew genIntelliJRuns` in terminal and then launch as Minecraft Client.

## Building:
- Run `gradlew build` in terminal and you will find your built jar in build/libs.
- Note: Building directly from the main branch might produce a build that is not functional or bugged, this is due to the fact that the developers use this branch when adding, modifying, or testing features, for the best experience either build from tags of previous releases or download the jar file from the releases tab.
